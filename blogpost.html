            <H1>THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</H1>
            <P>While a number of definitions of artificial intelligence (AI) have surfaced over the last few decades, John
                McCarthy offers the following definition in this 2004 paper (link resides outside ibm.com), " It is the science
                and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It is related to the
                similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to
                methods that are biologically observable."
