While a number of definitions of artificial intelligence (AI)
 have surfaced over the last few decades, John McCarthy offers 
 the following definition in this 2004 paper (link resides outside 
 ibm.com), " It is the science and engineering of making intelligent 
 machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It is related
 to the similar task of using computers to understand human 
 intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods
  that are biologically observable."
